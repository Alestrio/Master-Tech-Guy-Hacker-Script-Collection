# Useful Powershell Scripts to be the Ultimate Technology Master for mere humans

If you are like me, and you are the tech-guy for :
- Your family (Here, that's normal)
- Your family's friends (Okay, here that's clearly too much)
- Your family's friend's friends (...)

You will find here, useful Powershell scripts to avoid wasting too much time on someone else's computer "problem".

As of today, the repository contains :
- A script for everyone asking you "I will need you to move photos from my phone to my computer.". Move every photo in a folder (if it follows standard Android naming) to a folder named "AAAA-MM".

Now you've discovered this repo, everyone inviting you **only** for their computer problem won't piss you off as much as before (still a bit though).

Brought to you by a tech-guy, for tech-guys because of solidarity !
